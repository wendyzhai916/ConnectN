# About this Project

ConnectN is an in-class project assigned in ECS 32B (Spring 2020), offered in UC Davis. 

This project was completed in collaboration between wendyzhai916 and njande.

ConnectN is an interactive game with rules similar to the popular game of Connect4, but it allows numbers other than 4 to be the winning condition of the game.
